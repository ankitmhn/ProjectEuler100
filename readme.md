I shall be listing the problem statements here, coressponding solutions shall be in their respective files.

# Project Euler: Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the provided parameter value number.
## Tests:
multiplesOf3and5(1000) should return 233168.  
multiplesOf3and5(49) should return 543.  
multiplesOf3and5(19564) should return 89301183.  
multiplesOf3and5(8456) should return 16687353.  

# Project Euler: Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

## 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence that do not exceed the nth term, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
